Designing the college database with three entity Student, Teacher and Course, with their pivot table(Many to many relations)
StudentCourse and TeacherCourse. Used SQLite to connect to database and cursor as a pointer to specific database. The program
creates table when an object is created for the first time if the table is not created before. The tables are displayed at each
time the program is run. Have to add student, teacher and course by yourself. And then, have to enroll student to course and assign
teacher to course by yourself.
